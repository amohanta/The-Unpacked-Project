The Unpacked Project is meant to aid security researchers dealing with malware.The repositary consists of unpacked samples. 
A lot of time researchers have to spend time in unpacking a sample and reach the actual payload. It can aid resarcher to find IOCs,important string for creating signatures.

What you can get from the unpacked files:
1)importnat strings like malware name
2)sequence of API
3)Persistence mechanims
4)Armoring techniques like virtual Machine Detection, security Tools detection
5)Command and Control strings
6)Candidates for signatures

Note: The samples might not be perfectly unpacked so all the samples might not execute completely
Disclaimner: The intent of creating this repositary is not to distribute malware but to aid researchers to fight malware
