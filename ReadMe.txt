The Unpacked Project is meant to help malware researchers by provinding unpacked malware sample or  memory dumps conatining unpacked data.
Researchers have to spend time in unpacking a malware sample. This project provides unpacked samples so that researchers can directly look into the final payload and investgate the code and find importnat IOC. The project also suggests IOCs,important strings used for creating signatures. 

What you can get from the unpacked files?
1)important strings like malware name
2)sequence of API
3)Persistence mechanisms
4)Armoring techniques like virtual Machine Detection, security Tools detection
5)Command and Control strings
6)Candidates for signatures

Note: The samples might not be perfectly unpacked so all the samples might not execute completely
Disclaimner: The intent of creating this repositary is not to distribute malware but to aid researchers to fight malware
